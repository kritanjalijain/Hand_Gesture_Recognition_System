# Hand Gesture Recognition System
College Project- A dynamic hand gesture recognition system for controlling music player. This model recognizes hand gestures in real-time using the power of Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Project Description

The app consists of 3 different modes:
1. __**Data Collection Mode:**__ Allows the user to collect train, test, or validation data on a variety of hand gestures
2. __**Model Testing Mode:**__ Test the model's ability to discern between different gestures through real-time visualizations
3. __**Music-Player/Gesture Mode:**__ Use gestures to play music, pause music, and change the volume of music

## Packages Used
- OpenCV 
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- PyGame
- NumPy

## Files
Here's a list of files in the directory:
- `src/demo.py`: Contains all the functions to start and run the app
- `src/music`: Contains the song that will be played during 'gesture mode'
